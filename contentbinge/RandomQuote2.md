Bad filter is better than no filter because no filter means you have stopped trying

Quote Dion Waiters: "I'd rather go 0-30 than 0-9. Because you go 0-9, that means you stopped shooting. That means you lost confidence"

You can improve from very little gains every day. But you cant improve if you dont try.
