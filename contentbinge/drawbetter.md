1: get feedback
Art without feedback is pointless, doesnt get you anywhere
Simply doing something doesnt mean you will get good at it
Cycle: draw > compare to reference > find mistakes > take notes > correct mistakes > repeat

2: 85% rule
According to science doing something where you have 85% chance of success is most optimal 
Not hard enough to make you feel impossible and not easy enough to make you bored, more chance of success means more "fun" to a certain way

Rule 3: literal scrap because we do not have knowledge of what people do to improve, filler with my take

Break every thing down to simple concepts and shapes

Identify angle > draw simple shape > cut shape out into more complex shape > draw more shapes > repeat

Takes longer but almost certain to reveal issues or problems with my skill > makes it easier to do step 1

Step 4: link ideas and concepts ro build more solid foundations
